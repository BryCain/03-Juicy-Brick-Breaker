# Juicy Brick Breaker
Project 03 - Juicy Brick Breaker for MSCH-C220 at IU Bloomington. Created October 12, 2022.

This project is my attempt at a juicy brick breaker. I went with a neon theme, as the concept for this project reminded me of Pac-Man Championship Edition.

## Implementation
Includes music, sound effects, sprites for all elements, colored bricks, a comet trail for the ball, paddle animation, brick animation (both at the start of the game and when they are broken), screen shake, a unique UI theme, a neon-style WorldElement, and a shader for the fever mode bar.
